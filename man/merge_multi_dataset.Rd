\title{Merge Multiple Counts Datasets and Save to CSV}
\usage{
merge_multi_dataset(
  input_file_paths,
  output_csv_path,
  transpose_before_saving = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_file_paths}{A character vector of full paths to the count data files.}

\item{output_csv_path}{The full path for the output CSV file that will be created.}

\item{transpose_before_saving}{Logical. If TRUE (the default), the merged data frame
(samples x genes) will be transposed to (genes x samples) before being saved to the CSV.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the merged data frame (samples x genes). The primary
purpose is the side effect of saving the data to a file.
}
\description{
This function reads multiple count data files (e.g., from different experiments),
finds the intersection of genes (columns) across all files, merges the data
for these common genes, and saves the final data frame to a specified CSV file.
}
\details{
The function assumes input files have samples as rows and genes as columns.
Row names from the original files are preserved as row names in the merged data
frame, provided they are unique across all input files.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Define input and output files
  in_files <- c("path/to/dataset1.txt", "path/to/dataset2.txt")
  out_file <- "path/to/merged_data.csv"

  # Run the merge and save function
  merged_data <- merge_multi_dataset(
    input_file_paths = in_files,
    output_csv_path = out_file,
    transpose_before_saving = TRUE
  )
}
