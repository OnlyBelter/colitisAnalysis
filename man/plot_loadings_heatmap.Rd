\title{Plot Topic Loadings as a Faceted Heatmap}
\usage{
plot_loadings_heatmap(
  fit_object,
  color_palette = NULL,
  filter_by_treatment = NULL,
  k = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit_object}{A \code{fastTopics} fit object. The number of topics 'k' is
inferred from this object.}

\item{color_palette}{An optional named vector of colors. The names should
correspond to the topics (e.g., "k1", "k2"). If NULL, a default palette
is used.}

\item{filter_by_treatment}{A character string. If not NULL, the plot will be
filtered to only include Tissues that are present in this specified
Treatment group. For example, setting this to "DSS" will only show tissues
that were part of the DSS experiment. Defaults to NULL (shows all tissues).}

\item{k}{The number of topics.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
This function takes a fastTopics fit object and creates a complex, faceted plot
showing the topic proportions (loadings) for each sample. It includes extensive
data wrangling to structure the plot by sample metadata.
}
\details{
The function assumes that the sample names (i.e., \code{rownames(fit$L)}) follow a
specific format: \code{"Tissue_Day_Mouse_Treatment"}, for example, \code{"BM_d04_1_DSS"}.
It uses this structure to facet the plot.
