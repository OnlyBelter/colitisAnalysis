\usage{
plot_loadings_heatmap(
  fit_object,
  treatment_levels = NULL,
  tissue_levels = NULL,
  color_palette = NULL,
  save_to_file = NULL,
  fig_width = 16,
  fig_height = 9
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit_object}{A \code{fastTopics} fit object.}

\item{treatment_levels}{A character vector specifying which "Treatments" to
include in the plot and in what order they should appear as columns. If NULL,
all treatments are included in alphabetical order.}

\item{tissue_levels}{A character vector specifying which "Tissues" to include
in the plot and in what order they should appear as rows. If NULL, all
tissues are included in alphabetical order.}

\item{color_palette}{An optional named vector of colors. The names should
correspond to the topics (e.g., "k1", "k2"). If NULL, a default palette
is used.}

\item{save_to_file}{An optional character string specifying the full path to
save the plot file (e.g., "output/plot.png"). If NULL (the default), the
ggplot object is returned instead of being saved.}

\item{fig_width}{The width of the saved plot in inches. Defaults to 16.}

\item{fig_height}{The height of the saved plot in inches. Defaults to 9.}
}
\value{
If \code{save_to_file} is NULL, returns a \code{ggplot} object. If a path is provided,
the function saves the plot and invisibly returns the file path.
}
\description{
This function takes a fastTopics fit object and creates a complex, faceted plot
showing the topic proportions (loadings) for each sample.
}
\details{
The function assumes that the sample names (i.e., \code{rownames(fit$L)}) follow a
specific format: \code{"Tissue_Day_Mouse_Treatment"}, for example, \code{"BM_d04_1_DSS"}.
It uses this structure to facet the plot.
